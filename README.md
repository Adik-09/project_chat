# project_chat.

This is my real-time chatting application which i have made while learning django. In this application i have given features like User authentication and profile.
real time chatting, a system for accepting and rejecting friend request , indiviual and group chat and user friendly interface to interact.

* How to use ?
1. Make clone of the project.
2. Now run the command "python manage.py makemigrations" and then "python manage.py migrate" this will setup your database. [I have used dbsqlite as it a practice level app.]
3. now just run "python manage.py runserver" and your application is good to go.
4. A url link will be provided to you. first hit the url "the provided url/ak/login" which will direct you to login page.
5. Now from hear you can login and use the app.

In this app i have handled the backend logic and html, while the css is done by AI.
